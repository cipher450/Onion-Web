## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

This is the first WebApp that I have made since learning about developing web applications using ReactJS as my frontend framework and Fast-API in this project I applied what i have learned so far such as : 
- Creating various react components and using properties.
- Using state 
- Using useEffect to fetch API 
- Working with JsObjects
- Getting into using CSS Frameworks (Tailwind)
- Using pymongo to interact with mango databases
- Applying overall newly acquired knowledge...

## What is Onion-Web
the goal of onion-web is to collect as many .onion links as possible it combiens the search engling [ahmia](https://ahmia.fi/) and hopefully a growing Database of user submited links for now resaults are not pinged to check for status will add that in the near future
